# HestonModel Python Package
For the documentation see https://sarcasticmatrix.github.io/hestonModel/

This Python package implements the Heston model for option pricing and portfolio management using Monte Carlo simulations, the Carr-Madan method, and Fourier transforms. The package also includes functionality for optimal portfolio allocation using control techniques.

We assume that the stock is ruled by the Heston model under real world and martingale measures. Thus, skipping the reasoning from real-world measures $\mathbb P = (\mathbb P_1,\mathbb P_2)$ to martingale measures $\mathbb Q(\lambda) = [\mathbb Q_1(\lambda),\mathbb Q_2(\lambda)]$, parametrised by the drift parameter $\lambda$ under the equivalent martingale measure. Using the Cholesky decomposition and dsanovâ€™s Theorem,

$$dS_t = rS_t dt + \sqrt{v_t}S_t (\rho dW^{Q_1}_t + \sqrt{1-\rho^2} dW^{Q_2}_t),$$

$$dv_t = \kappa (\theta - v_t)dt + \sigma\sqrt{v_t}dW_t^{Q_1}.$$

With $W^{Q_1}$ and $W^{Q_2}$ orthogonal Wiener processes under martingale measures. For the proofs, see `report.pdf`.

  - `drift_emm (float)`: Drift parameter under the equivalent martingale measure ($\lambda$).
  - `sigma (float)`: Volatility of variance ($\sigma$).
  - `rho (float)`: Correlation between the Brownian motions of asset price and variance ($\rho$).
  - `T (float)`: Time to maturity.
  - `K (float)`: Strike price of the option.
  - `premium_volatility_risk (float, optional)`: Premium for volatility risk, default is `0.0`.

#### `monte_carlo_price`
Simulates sample paths and estimates the call price with a simple Monte Carlo Method.
- **Parameters:**
        - scheme (str): the discretization scheme used
        - n (int): number of points in a path

            - infimum (float): infimum of the confidence interval
            - supremum (float): supremum of the confidence interval

#### `fourier_transform_price`
Computes the price of a European call option on the underlying asset S following a Heston model using the Heston formula.
- **Parameters:**
        - t (float): time

- **Returns:**
        - price (float): option price
        - error (float): error in the option price computation

#### `carr_madan_price`
Computes the price of a European call option on the underlying asset S following a Heston model using Carr-Madan Fourier pricing.
- **Parameters:**
        - t (float): time, set at 0 by default

- **Returns:**
        - price (float): option price
        - error (float): error in the option price computation
